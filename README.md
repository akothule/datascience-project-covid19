# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Our World In Data (OWID) provides extensive research and data on Coronavirus Pandemic. I am using this data for analysis of world-wide COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the impact of global health crisis. I am also using this data for visualizing the vaccination progress by country and up close review of how Delta variant, which originated in India has rapidly spread across United States and other countries. 

I worked on COVID-19 data analysis and prepared a report of world-wide COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the impact of global health crisis. Self-taught Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Plotly framework for data visualization to understand the spread of Coronavirus variants and progress on vaccinating global population to curb one of the worst pandemics in modern history.

The Jupyter Notebook is published [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/5d016197-5fbe-4628-9354-c624dff97158/view?access_token=889b88e58fadf6b98f513ceb647a9125f1d1fedc1e18197a4ad95952c1d01328
